LINEAR SEARCH 
PROGRAM TO SHOW LINEAR SEARCH ALGORITHM IMPLEMENTATION

Array size and inputs are obtained from the user.The algorithm searches for an element in 0(n).
It is a sequential search in that a loop is employed for each array element to be checked until a match is found.
When a match is found,the program prints found and then terminates to avoid further comparisons thus improving on efficiency.
